As a Machine Learning Engineer with a passion for personalized user experiences, I’m eager to contribute to Spotify’s mission of making a best place for human creativity and connecting artists and fans in meaningful ways. With a master’s in data analytics and hands-on experience in ML model development, I thrive on analyzing every interaction, every click, and every data point to create personalized journeys for users, making their everyday enjoyable and inspired.

At GKN Aerospace, I created an AI model for real-time process monitoring in wire-directed energy deposition, achieving 99% accuracy. This experience enhanced my skills in anomaly detection, sequence prediction, and handling large datasets—key for optimizing ML models and driving business impact.

In my role at Viviotex, I deployed and refined large language models like Llama, GPT, and Whisper for text tasks. My expertise with Microsoft Azure in building scalable solutions will directly benefit Spotify’s ML initiatives, particularly in developing personalized user experiences and enhancing conversion strategies.

Like a true ML model, I learn and iterate constantly—driving optimization, testing hypotheses, and fine-tuning solutions until they hit just the right note. Together, I believe we can push Spotify's user engagement and growth to the next level.
